curvendimension
===============

This library tries to encapsulate the representation of n-dimensional polygonal curves into a single class called PolygonalCurve. This is a templated class, where the type for representing coordinates and the number of dimensions are template parameters. The class also accept as template parameters a class for representing n-dimensional points and a related class for representing n-dimensional vectors; these, however, have default implementations called PointN and VectorN.
